# Stack
Open Source AWS Standard Decentralized Storage Protocol Built For Developers.
Stack is an open source decentralized storage protocol that supports the AWS Standard. Stack will distribute data stored based on the AWS S3 standard in IPFS. It supports IPFS mainet and private networks by the deployment of IPFS nodes. Our goal is to make the life of a developer easier.

# Why Stack?
Decentralised cloud storage might be the future of data storage and it appears that the future is coming sooner than expected. With the internet itself, a centralised ecosystem monopolised by a cartel of tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google, data stored in it via the cloud becomes exposed to and at risk of attacks. This necessitates an alternative data storage option in which data remains accessible but is kept safer and more secure and not under the control of big online entities. This is where stack comes into play.
