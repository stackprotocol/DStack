# DStack
Open Source AWS Standard Decentralized Storage Protocol Built For Developers.
Stack is an open source decentralized storage protocol that supports the AWS Standard. Stack will distribute data stored based on the AWS S3 standard in IPFS. It supports IPFS mainet and private networks by the deployment of IPFS nodes. Our goal is to make the life of a developer easier.

# Why DStack?
Decentralised cloud storage might be the future of data storage and it appears that the future is coming sooner than expected. With the internet itself, a centralised ecosystem monopolised by a cartel of tech giants such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google, data stored in it via the cloud becomes exposed to and at risk of attacks. This necessitates an alternative data storage option in which data remains accessible but is kept safer and more secure and not under the control of big online entities. This is where DStack comes into play.

1.With DStack Data is more secure and kept private. The traditional centralised system gives the hosts a great deal of power in that they can potentially eavesdrop on data being stored and even disclose them to third parties. This same model is also vulnerable to cyber attacks that can result in a data breach or complete loss. These issues are addressed by decentralised storage, mainly because data is stored in different nodes as fragments, making it near impossible to snoop in on them, disclose them to others or hack them. Data is also encrypted, thereby adding another layer of protection. This is by far the biggest benefit of this modern storage model.

2.With us your file loss is minimised considerably. There are thousands of nodes all around the world already and millions more coming in the near future. This ensures redundancy in which multiple copies of each data fragment are stored on different nodes. Users will thus be able to access a file even if a node or two are unavailable at any given moment or in case there are transmission errors. In other words, a single file can have countless copies.

3.Download speeds are faster. Traditional client-server data storage models are prone to network bottlenecks during instances of high network traffic, or when traffic is more than what the network can accommodate. But with decentralised data storage utilising peer-to-peer technology, the need for a central server is eliminated. In its place are countless nodes where data shards are stored. Users can therefore bypass using a central server when downloading their files and instead retrieve the data fragments from their respective nodes. Fewer bottlenecks in turn mean faster downloads.

4.Our Files are easier to transfer. Since data shards are stored in various nodes worldwide, file transfers in decentralised cloud storage are easier and more convenient regardless of distance. In other words, data will be available to users anywhere they are on the globe since information fragments are generally stored in over 80 different nodes, with only 30 required to reconstitute a particular file.

5.Decentralised storage data is cost-efficient. A big reason why this model is less expensive is due to it having a marketplace of vendors willing to offer high-quality storage space and this then results in healthy competition that drives down pricing. Additionally, data in decentralised storage is brought right at the usersâ€™ endpoints, further lowering costs.

# Life Made Easy
DStack brings Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) standard to IPFS. With cost-effective storage classes and easy-to-use management features, you can optimize costs, organize data, and configure fine-tuned access controls to meet specific business, organizational, and compliance requirements.
